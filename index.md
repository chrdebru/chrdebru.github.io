Christophe Debruyne (he/they) is an Assistant Professor (chargé de cours) at the [Montefiore Institute](https://www.montefiore.uliege.be/) of [Liège University](https://www.uliege.be/). Christophe conducts research in ontology and knowledge engineering, data modeling, Linked Data, and declarative approaches to data integration. He applies (and has applied) his research in various domains ranging from digital humanities and the cultural sector to e-commerce and geospatial data management.

In 2013, Christophe obtained a PhD in computer science with a dissertation entitled "Grounding Ontologies with Social Processes and Natural Language". In his thesis, he investigated the role of the exchange of natural language definitions of concepts (called glosses) in the social interactions that take place when a community of stakeholders is collaboratively constructing ontologies. Before his PhD, Christophe obtained a Bachelor in Applied Computer Science at Hogeschool Gent (University College Gent) in 2005, a BSc in Computer Science and an MSc in Applied Sciences and Engineering: Computer Science at the VUB in 2007 and 2009 respectively. You can find more information about his education and work experience on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/christophedebruyne).
