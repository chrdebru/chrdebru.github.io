			<h1 class="page-header">About (my) cats</h1>
					
			<p>Many of you know I'm a (crazy) cat person. On this page, I will provide a non-exhaustive list of cats that have lived or have been spotted in the Cat Cave (my place in Saint-Gilles, Brussels).</p>

			<h3 class="page-header">Victor (April 2012 – ...)</h3>
			
			<p><a>Victor was adopted from <a href="https://helpanimals.be/">Help Animals</a>, a shelter in Brussels. Presented to us as "Victor" by one of the lovely volunteers at the shelter, it turned out his name on adoption papers was "Victoir". I decided to stick to "Victor", it just... sounded better. Victor was put for adoption because a newborn baby was allergic to cats. He's royal,  beautiful,  intelligent, and  KNOWS that he's all of these things. He was and has always been a spoiled cat, and yet, for some reason, he's the one opening our neighbors' garbage bags for cheese and chicken. He IS the uninvited guest at our neighbors' barbecues.  He was adopted in April 2012, when he was about one year old. </a></p>

			<h3 class="page-header">Louis (July 2012 – January 2019)</h3>
			
			<p>Oh, Louis... Louis was the sweetest tom I have ever met. Beautiful, lovely, and just a tad stupid. Louis was the kind of cat to get lost in our neighbor's garden. He was physically able to get back; he just gets disoriented. Louis was found wounded in the middle of a road in Ciney, likely hit by a car. We were lucky there was a vet "on duty" around. He had no chip, and his chances for survival were slim. He survived, and since no one reported a lost cat, we adopted him a week later on the 10th of July 2012. He suffered from a mild concussion and a couple of bruises. Unfortunately, this lovely tom developed a tumor that was crushing his heart and lungs. He was euthanized on the 14th of January 2019. The first picture is very dear to me. Louis was very skittish and hid for the first two weeks. And then, one day, he decided to stick around and never stopped purring.</p>

			<h3 class="page-header">Bettina (August 2013 – ...)</h3>
			
			<p>We came back from a trip to Madrid. We were opening the front door when an older woman approached us. She was holding a small cat in her arms. She looked confused and told us she found this cat, but she couldn't keep her as her three dogs were aggressive. As no vet in the neighborhood was available, she was approaching random strangers. We took over the cat in the hopes of finding her owner. She was young but severely malnourished and frail. After two days, she's showed clear signs of recovery: cleaning herself and being playful. She had no chip. You couldn't but fall in love with this adorable cat. As she was, she was named after Bettina Graziani, a french model. Little did we know that she would end up becoming the most adorable plump girl that tripled her weight. Fun fact: she loves a good spanking.</p>

			<h3 class="page-header">Gaston (February 2019 – ...) </h3>
			
			<p>When Louis passed away, Victor and Bettina became... "lethargic". Victor and Bettina got along, but most of their interactions involved Louis. Victor didn't have his playmate, and Bettina lost her cuddle buddy. We adopted Gaston from <a href="https://catrescue.be/" target="_blank">CatRescue</a>. He was found on the streets, and the people that rescued him initially thought he was a gray cat, but he was just very dirty. He wasn't shy around people, so he must have gotten lost. He had no chip, unfortunately. Gaston is a very playful and mischievous cat. He constantly learns new tricks and loves to tease Bettina. Victor took on the role of big brother and teaches him how to cat. He apparently loves to get dirty; one of his favorite habits is rolling in barbecue ashes. His name on the adoption papers was "Chachon", but I changed it to "Gaston" after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_(comics)" target="_blank">Gaston Lagaffe</a>. It rhymes, and the name suits him.</p>

			<h3 class="page-header">René</h3>
			
			<div class="row" style="margin: 20px;">
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>I gave this cat the name "René". René is a cat that squats during summer, spring, and autumn breaks. Thinking he was regularly lost, we went to the vet. He has an unregistered chip, which was implanted in Marocco! So he, is in effect, a Moroccan cat. He just enters the place and gets comfortable. He also knews where everything is (food bowls, litter boxes, beds,...), so I think he already wandered inside without us knowing. I hypothesize that his owners leave him outside when they travel, which would explain why he only shows us during extended school holidays.</p>
