The second book I finished in 2025 was [Als kasseien konden spreken: Negen eeuwen Vlaamsesteenweg in Brussel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222937456-als-kasseien-konden-spreken) by Lucas Catherine. I enjoy learning about the history of Brussels. It is well-written, though a few stupid typos slipped through the cracks. I was surprised to learn about Brussels' protestant past. I might have learned it in high school and I really should brush up on Belgium's medieval history.

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
