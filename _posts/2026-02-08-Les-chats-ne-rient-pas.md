I was given a bunch of books written by Japanese authors featuring cats. The first one I read was [Les chats ne rient pas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55514764-les-chats-ne-rient-pas) by [Kôsuke Mukai](https://www.imdb.com/fr/name/nm0467569/). It was an easy, enjoyable read, but not really extraordinary in my opinion.

My rating: ⭐⭐
