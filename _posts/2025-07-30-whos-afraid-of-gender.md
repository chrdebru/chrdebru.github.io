Not afraid of being accused of being woke, I was looking forward to reading [Judith Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler)'s [Who's Afraid of Gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who%27s_Afraid_of_Gender%3F). I was aware of their work entitled Gender Trouble (or *Trouble dans le genre* in French), often cited by friends in conversations. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book, and I found their arguments extremely well-articulated and accessible. What I also appreciated is that their arguments were often repeated in different ways: once outlined, then exemplified, and then finally repeated in a summarizing manner. That made certain parts quite verbose, but I'm sure it helps readers understand the oftentimes nuanced arguments.

It wasn't a difficult read, but it required concentration. It thus ensured I was always in the right mindset when reading this book.

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
