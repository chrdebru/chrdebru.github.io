[Paul Kidby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kidby)'s [Designing Terry Pratchett's Discworld](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215087432-designing-terry-pratchett-s-discworld) was such a lovely bedtime read. The book was such a lovely bedtime read. While Christmas shopping, I stumbled upon this book and was easily persuaded to give myself this little treat. I‚Äôm a huge Terry Pratchett fan, and this book made me want to reread all Discworld novels. It is a shame that there won‚Äôt be any more such novels. I love Kidby‚Äôs illustrations, and as it happens, I also gifted myself the The World of Terry Pratchett puzzle he illustrated. I finished the puzzle about two weeks ago, so I was excited to see a picture of the work in progress that would become the puzzle. I give this book five stars, but that is undoubtedly because of fanboy bias. üòâ
