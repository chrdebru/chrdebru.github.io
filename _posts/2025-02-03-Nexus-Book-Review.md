The third book I finished in 2025 was [Nexus: A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/204927599-nexus) by [Yuval Noah Harari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Noah_Harari). While it came out in 2024, I read it in January 2025. The authors describes how AI could be used and abused by totalitarian regimes. It was eerie to read how the author seems to have predicted some current events that are currently taking place in The United States. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
