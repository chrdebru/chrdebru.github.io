On Tuesday, the 12th of December, I finished [Joé Rodrigues dos Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Rodrigues_dos_Santos)'s [Protocole Chaos](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/225655786-protocole-chaos). This book was gifted to me for my birthday. The person knew I'm not one to read such kinds of "thrillers." It was an enjoyable read, and I particularly enjoyed the chapter on the sources. That said, much like the works of [Dan Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Brown), I'm pretty sure I won't pick up another book in that series. I'm more into science fiction and fantasy. Will I be able to finish another book in December?

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
