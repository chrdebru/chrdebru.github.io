I just finished my first book of 2026; [Terry Pratchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett)'s [Truckers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23346759-truckers), the first book in [The Bromeliad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nome_Trilogy). I am unfamiliar with Pratchett's childrens books, so I decided to give that a go. It was quite an enjoyable read, but I guess I would have enjoyed it more as a teenager or young adult. I found that Pratchett very gently questioned how beliefs are made, used, challenged, or argued over within a community, in a very accessible manner for children. Through characters and character development, Pratchett also explains how one's beliefs can evolve or serve as an anchor, providing a sense of security. 

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐
