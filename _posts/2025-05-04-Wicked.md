My friend Despoina offered me a copy of [Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37442.Wicked) by Gregory Mguire when she came back from New York last year. I have been a huge fan of [the musical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(musical)) (well before [Glee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glee_(TV_series)) made it cool), but I never read the book. The book was DARK... Very dark at times. It was a more than enjoyable read. 

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
