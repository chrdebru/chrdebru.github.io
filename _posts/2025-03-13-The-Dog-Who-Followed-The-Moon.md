I read the Dutch translation of James Norbury's [The Dog Who Followed the Moon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/210051588-the-dog-who-followed-the-moon). While I thoroughly enjoyed Norbury's other books (and most notably [The Cat Who Taught Zen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123239380-the-cat-who-taught-zen) that I read last year), I was disappointed in this book. The illustrations were excellent, but I found the story not coherent. One illustration didn't fit the narrative and that threw me off. I also found the story not as profound as the others. I had the impression this book was hastily produced, which may be due to Norbury's success. I don't see myself telling this story to kids. So, yeah, ... I give this book two stars because the illustrations are lovely.


My rating: ⭐⭐
