The [Salem witch trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem_witch_trials) have fascinated me for years, and I was *SO* stoked when I had the possibility to visit Salem with my friend [Tim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Fish) back in February 2020, just before COVID hit. Another friend gifted me [Arthur Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Miller)'s [The Crucible](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17250.The_Crucible), a play inspired by those events. While it was written as *"an allegory for McCarthyism, when the United States government persecuted people accused of being communists."* (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crucible)), I enjoyed reading and imagining how the hysteria could have played out back in the sixteenth century. It was a thrilling read!

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
