I used to be an avid reader, but it is difficult to find the time to read for pleasure. I try to read at least 12 to 14 books a year. That is indeed not a lot, but that number does not include the papers, theses, textbooks, etc. which I read for my profession. I have decided to blog about the books I read.

The first book I finished in 2025 was [La Machine à détruire: Pourquoi il faut en finir avec la finance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/209089219-la-machine-d-truire) by Aline Farès and Jérémy Van Houtte. It was gifted to me for my birthday in 2024. I love comics, and it was interesting to have a fairly in-depth explanation how financial institutions operate, the things that lead to the 2008 crisis, and everything that happened at Belgian, European, and global level. I was only annoyed that quite a few panels were reused throughout.

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐
