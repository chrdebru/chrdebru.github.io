I finished [Petit Pays](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30631883-petit-pays), written by [Gaël Faye](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga%C3%ABl_Faye), while on a plane to Dublin. I recall the conflicts and the [Rwandan Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide) being reported on the news while I was a kid, but I paid little attention to it as a child. As such, I'm unfortunately unfamiliar with the events that occurred during my lifetime. I devoured this book and it such a good read. While translations exists, this book must have been hard to translate. Chapter 29 really got me, and the final chapter left me in chills.  

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
