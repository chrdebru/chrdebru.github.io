I read [Le Chat qui voulait sauver la bibliothèque](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/229149408-le-chat-qui-voulait-sauver-la-biblioth-que) by [Sōsuke Natsukawa
](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5593707.S_suke_Natsukawa), the second book in a series of books written by Japanese authors featuring cats that was gifted to me. I'm surprised the author does not have a Wikipedia page. I found it naive at first, but I had to remember its intended audience was young adults. It was a very enjoyable read. Upon reading this review, I learned this book is the second in a series. Should I add [Le Chat qui voulait sauver les livres](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60700414-le-chat-qui-voulait-sauver-les-livres) to my list? Maybe.

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
