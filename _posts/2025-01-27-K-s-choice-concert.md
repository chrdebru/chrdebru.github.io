I attended [Time is a Parasite - 30 Years of K's Choice](https://www.abconcerts.be/nl/agenda/time-is-a-parasite-30-years-of-ks-choice) at the Ancienne Belgique on the 27th of January, 2025. I was, and still am, quite the fan of [K's Choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%27s_Choice). I allowed me to relive some of my angsty teenage years. I was surprised I didn't bump into anyone I knew. It was a wonderful concert. ❣️

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
