I finished [Terry Pratchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett)'s [Diggers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/989030.Diggers), the second book in [The Bromeliad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nome_Trilogy), on the 12th of January. Compared to the [first](./2026-01-05-Truckers.md), this was a page turner! And it contained a lot more British humor. Again, Pratchett manages to introduce and explain (complicated) societal subjects to a young audience, such as patriarchy and emancipation.

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
