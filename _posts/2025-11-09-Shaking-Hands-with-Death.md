Even though I'm in the middle of reading [Terry Pratchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett) *and [Jacqueline Simpson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Simpson)*'s (*) [The Folklore of Discworld](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2429032.The_Folklore_of_Discworld), I stumbled upon his lecture on assisted death while visiting Waterstones Brussels, my favorite bookstore there. This lecture, titled "[Shaking Hands with Death](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733921-shaking-hands-with-death)," was written and published only this July. It was a very touching book, and the lecture was even more profound (to me, at least) when read. For those interested in the lecture, it is available on YouTube.

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

(*) Update 2025-11-19: I forgot to add the second author's name! My bad. 😕
