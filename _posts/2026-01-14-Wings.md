I finished [Terry Pratchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett)'s [Wings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34519.Wings), the third book in [The Bromeliad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nome_Trilogy), on the 14th of January. Yeah. Now I know why it is called the Bromeliad triogy. 💓 This book was good. The first book was turned into a [series](https://www.imdb.com/fr/title/tt0105646), and I believe the second two merit an animated series as well.

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
