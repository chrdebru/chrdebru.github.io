I love reading a good comic book before bed, and I had [Randy Shilts: et la fake news du patient zéro](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/210249009-randy-shilts) by Clément Xavier and Héloïse Chochois on my stack. The book is about [Randy Shilts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Shilts) and his role in ensuring attention was drawn to the emerging AIDS crisis in the United States, even though his means to this end were... questionable. I appreciated how the comic book tells the story of how the misrepresentation of facts ultimately led to the public attention needed for action to start to take place in a very accessible manner. 

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
