While I initially had a difficult time adjusting to Ireland, I now remember my time there fondly. In 2014, the DRI top-floor gang encouraged me to follow the Oh My God, What a Complete Aisling group on Facebook. The creators of that group, Emer McLysaght and Sarah Breen, then went on to write a series of books around some of the characters. Reading these books helps me reminisce about my time in Dublin.

While I loved the first book, I was somewhat disappointed with the second. This is why it took me a while to come around to reading the third, which was published in 2019. I must say that the [third book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44657501-once-twice-three-times-an-aisling) in the series was more enjoyable than the second. It has renewed my faith in the series, and I may be tempted to consider reading the fourth and fifth books. As I am almost eight years behind, and the books were written in their time, it is amusing to see how aspects of this book have become dated. The books mention some stars favorably, well before those stars have fallen out of grace. So, for those reading the books, be mindful of that. üôÇ

I give it a solid 3 out of 5 stars!
