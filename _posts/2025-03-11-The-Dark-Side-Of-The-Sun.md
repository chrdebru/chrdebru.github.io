I finally read Terry Pratchett's [The Dark Side of the Sun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/181010.The_Dark_Side_of_the_Sun). I'm happy I read it after reading the Discworld novels, as this was his first novel and he wasn't as fluent as he was when he started the Discworld novels. That said, I did enjoy catching a few ideas that would later be incorporated in the Discworld novels! üôÇ
