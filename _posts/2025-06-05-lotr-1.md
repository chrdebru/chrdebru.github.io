It comes as no surprise that I, as a geek, am a big fan of The Lord of the Rings. The picture is a copy of my book, which has been in my possession for over 20 years! This is my third time reading the books. And as this beast of a book contains the usual three books, I will report on my progress by these volumes. I'm reading it for a third time, so the five stars are self-explanatory, no?

Yes, I'm reading it in Dutch, but that's because the book holds sentimental value. I've had it since I was a teenager. And, strangely enough, I prefer the title in Dutch: "Under the Spell of the Ring." I find it more... fitting.

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
