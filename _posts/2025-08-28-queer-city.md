Today I finished [Peter Ackroyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Ackroyd)'s [Queer City: Gay London from the Romans to the Present Day](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31706259-queer-city). It was a book I purchased in London earlier this year. A trip to London was gifted to us for our marriage by our Irish chums living in Hackney. I always love learning about a city's queery history. I loved the cheek and humor in the author's writing. I didn't know the author, but reading this book made me look up his other works. He apparently wrote a book titled "Dressing Up: Transvestism and Drag: The History of an Obsession" in 1979. I will try to find a copy. üòÉ
