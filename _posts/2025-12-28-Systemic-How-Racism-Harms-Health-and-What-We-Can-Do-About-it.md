I finished [Layal Liverpool](https://layalliverpool.com/)'s "[Systemic: How Racism Harms Health and What We Can Do About It](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/227965028-bloomsbury-systemic-how-racism-harms-health-and-what-we-can-do-about-it)" just before the end of 2025. I found this book in Hodges Figgis whilst in Dublin. This book was written in a very accessible manner. The author uses peer-reviewed literature to support claims, as well as anecdotes to illustrate problems. I love how the author explained various (difficult) concepts, such as intersectionality, the nonsensical nature of race from a biological point of view, racism in (life) sciences, ... I hope this book will be translated into French so that I can gift it to friends!

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
