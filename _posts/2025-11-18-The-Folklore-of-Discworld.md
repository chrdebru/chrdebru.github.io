And I finished [Terry Pratchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett) and [Jacqueline Simpson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Simpson)'s [The Folklore of Discworld](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2429032.The_Folklore_of_Discworld). It was an enjoyable read! I must admit I'm not too acquainted with (English and Irish) folklore, but it was delightful to see how they influenced certain aspects of Discworld. There were subtle references that flew over my head! 🙂

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
