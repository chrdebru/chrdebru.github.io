I just finished [Pythagore à la plage : Les secrets des nombres dans un transat](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58815102-pythagore-la-plage), which translates to "Pythagoras at the Beach: The Secrets of Numbers in a Deckchair," written by [Jean-Paul Delahaye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Delahaye). I was an enjoyable and accessible read, though nothing out of the extraordinary. That said, the book gave me plenty of inspiration for new exercises for my course on [Functional Programming](https://www.programmes.uliege.be/cocoon/cours/INFO0054-1.html)!

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐
