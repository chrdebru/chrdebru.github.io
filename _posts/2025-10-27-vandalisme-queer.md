[Vandalisme queer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203086790-vandalisme-queer) is a compilation of three essays written by [Sara Ahmed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Ahmed) and translated into French by Emma Bigé and Mabeuko Oberty. I didn't know the authors, but bells rang when I learned that she was the professor who resigned in protest of sexual harassment of students by staff that was not handled (adequately). I recall hearing about this when I was a research fellow in Ireland. I wanted to learn more about this author after reading Judith Butler's work earlier this year, and this was such an enlightening read! The three essays are from her blog and often refer to her books, and I must admit I will be adding her books to my wishlist.

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
