Terry Pratchett's [Strata](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34493.Strata) was quite enjoyable to read. It is said to be Pratchett's early exploration of what would later become the Discworld series, and it was fun to discover some of the ideas that would appear in that series. I also enjoyed the SciFi clichés in the book and how Pratchett was able to write a compelling female character that did not fall into stereotypical tropes.

My rating: ⭐⭐⭐
