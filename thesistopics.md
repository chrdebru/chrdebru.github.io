Alternatively, students who have followed either INFO9014 (Knowledge Representation and Reasoning) or INFO9016 (Advanced Databases) are welcome to propose a topic on knowledge graph generation, knowledge graph management, knowledge graph organization, knowledge graph storage, or any other subject pertaining to data, databases, data modelling and data engineering. Students should come up with a concrete and well-defined thesis problem or topic. Students must be mindful that their proposals need to be discussed and approved. Students are encouraged to contact me for a meeting and are expected to come prepared.
